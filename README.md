Maplunky is an open-source, fan-made "what you see is what you get" map editor for Spelunky HD:

It provides super easy editing of multiplayer deathmatch maps, allowing for a whole new dimension of fun using both the singleplayer and multiplayer map tiles.  
Maplunky is powered by node-webkit and an assortment of JS libraries. These are all bundled together nicely into a single, portable app using Enigma Virtual Box.

**Features:**

 - Automatic locating of your Spelunky install, either via GOG or Steam (if this fails, Maplunky will ask for it instead)
 - Add and delete blocks via a handy tile brush using mouse left/right click.
 - Switch between deathmatch maps, emptying or reverting them at any time.
 - Copy-paste of raw map data, for those who might want to take things into a text editor by hand.
 - Ability to export maps to file, and re-import them simply by using file drag 'n' drop.

*NOTE:* This project is still a work in progress. Bugs will exist, and not all map blocks are added yet (some of them don't work in deathmatch, and others have abnormal behaviors that will probably crash the game).  
Feel free to hunt down any map blocks that were missed, and are a must-have. This is also open to pull requests, especially if anyone wants to consider tackling non-deathmatch maps.

**Wishlist:**
- Modify Spelunky HD so that it launches directly into the deathmatch screen. Yup, that part of the video is a lie!
- Find a way of disabling the menu transition delays, they're really slow.
- A cool car. Maybe a Toyota Supra MK3, or perhaps the Bugatti Type 57 Atlantic...aww yeah.

**Credits:**
- Maplunky is inspired by the original map editor that came with [Frozlunky](http://sashavol.com/frozlunky/), a Spelunky HD mod that adds the brilliance of co-op gameplay
- A big thanks to [Liam](https://github.com/LiamKarlMitchell) for figuring out the patchable maps in the game files.
